# Rationale by Day

## [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1)
[My solution](src/solution/Day01.cpp) is nothing too special.
I decided to not get too fancy with the parser right away and just parsed the numbers using their fixed width.
Sorting them made part 1 go really well, just sum the absolute differences.
Part 2 was a classic `map` scenario made easier by not needing to keep track of the numbers already counted.
It was cool to remember the default insert of a value when using `[]` to access values, that cleaned up the code a little.

## [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2)
[My solution](src/solution/Day02.cpp) coming soon...
