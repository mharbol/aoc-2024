# Advent of Code - 2024
Doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for [2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) in [C++](https://isocpp.org/).
As always, probably none of these solutions are optimal.

## Why C++?
Why not?
Originally, I decided to do this year in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) but have been writing less C++ at work lately.
I decided this would be a fun way to get a little more of it in my life.
Zig will have to wait until next year unless I think of something else.
